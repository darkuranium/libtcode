libtcode is a lightweight library for encoding and decoding text.

Currently, it is a C99 library, though I have plans to make it work with C89.

It currently decoding and encoding [for]:
- URLs
- XML string with entities (note: &#xxxx; entities are not yet supported)
- Base64

It is released under the 2-clause BSD license (see the file COPYING.txt
for more info).
